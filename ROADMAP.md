<sup>1</sup> Depending on how your GoXLR works, this may require a reboot.  
<sup>2</sup> Profiles are 'cross platform', so Windows profiles should work with the util, and vice versa  
<sup>3</sup> Currently only configurable via the `goxlr-client`
<sup>4</sup> UI is not complete (and is messy), but all functionality is present

## Not Completed
* Scribbles
  * Generally just a low priority, not overly complicated to achieve, but also not really that important, 
    will arrive soon!

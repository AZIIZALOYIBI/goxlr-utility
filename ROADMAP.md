# Roadmap
*Last Updated for 0.5.0 Release*

## Completed Features
* Initialisation of Devices under Linux<sup>1</sup>
* Mic and Main Profile Management (Load / Save / New)<sup>2</sup>
* Microphone Selection and Gain
* Fader Assignments
* Fader Mute buttons (Mute channel, Mute to X, Press and Hold)

* Bleep Button Volume
* Noise Gate and Compressor
* Microphone Equalizer
* Equalizer Fine Tune<sup>3</sup>
* Audio Routing
* The Voice Effects Panel

<sup>1</sup> Depending on how your GoXLR works, this may require a reboot.  
<sup>2</sup> Profiles are 'cross platform', so Windows profiles should work with the util, and vice versa  
<sup>3</sup> Currently only configurable via the `goxlr-client`

## Not Completed
* Sampler
  * Due to the nature of Linux audio, this is a little more complex to deal with. Some preliminary code has been created
    and functions correctly, however it's massively incomplete and complicated to use.
* Scribbles
  * Generally just a low priority, not overly complicated to achieve, but also not really that important, 
    will arrive soon!
